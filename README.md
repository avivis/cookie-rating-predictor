# Cookie Recipe Rating Predictor
ML model that predicts the recipe rating of a chocolate chip cookie recipe based on the measurements of various ingredients in the recipe.

## Description
This is a multiple linear regression model predicting the allrecipes.com rating (on a scale of 3 to 5) of a chocolate chip cookie recipe based on the ratio of various ingredients (fat (oil, butter, etc.), sugar, brown sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, baking soda, salt, and chocolate chips) in the recipe.

This model is trained on a dataset of allrecipes.com chocolate chip cookie recipies with ratings from 3-5 and the proportions of fat (oil, butter, etc.), sugar, brown sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, baking soda, salt, and chocolate chips in the recipes. 

More information on the dataset, the training of the model, and the predictions can be found in the Jupyter Notebook file.
