# Cookie Recipe Rating Predictor
Machine learning model that predicts the recipe rating of a chocolate chip cookie recipe based on the measurements of various ingredients in the recipe. üç™

## Description
This is a multiple linear regression model predicting the allrecipes.com rating of a chocolate chip cookie recipe based on the ratio of various ingredients (fat (oil, butter, etc.), sugar, brown sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, baking soda, salt, and chocolate chips) in the recipe.

Finding recipes online can be overwhelming. I was curious what makes a good chocolate chip cookie, and if there was any pattern to all of the highly rated chocolate chip cookie recipes. Baking is all about ratios, and machine learning is all about patterns -- finding a pattern to the ratios of ingredients in various levels of "good" chocolate chip cookies could unlock what ratios make a chocolate chip cookie amazing.

This model is trained on a dataset of allrecipes.com chocolate chip cookie recipies with ratings and the proportions of fat (oil, butter, etc.), sugar, brown sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, baking soda, salt, and chocolate chips in the recipes. I created a dataset of recipes, all from allrecipes.com and with 10+ ratings. I then trained my multiple linear regression model on this data to identify any patterns and make predictions. More info on the model and how it was created can be found in the Jupyter Notebook file!
